% Input parameters list:
% TXPPDU             - Tx waveform.
% SENDERPOSITION     - Position (x,y,z) vector of the sender as double
% values.
% RECEIVERPOSITION   - Position (x,y,z) vector of the receiver as double
% values.
% POWERLEVEL         - Transmit power level in dBm as a double value.
% TXGAIN             - Transmitter gain in Db as a double value.
% RXGAIN             - Receiver gain in Db as a double value.
% CHANNELWIDTH       - Bandwidth of channel in MHz as integer.
%
% Output parameters list
% RXPSDU             - Modified signal after passing through channel.
% RXPOWERDBM         - Received signal strength by receiver in dBm.
